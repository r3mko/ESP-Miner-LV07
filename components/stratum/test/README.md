# Stratum test support

These modules test how pool jobs become ASIC jobs. They use the real mining and
job-task code with controlled inputs and recorded outputs.

## Test levels

- A **unit test** checks one function or a small module with direct inputs and
  outputs.
- A **component test** runs a task with the related job and mining code. Test
  doubles replace task scheduling, hardware, and other external boundaries.

The common-job builder tests use the production mining code with isolated
allocation failures. The task-to-Bitmain pipeline tests and application stubs
live under `components/asic/test`; this test component has no ASIC dependency.

## Support modules

| Module | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `mining_test_bindings.h` | Gives the mining functions private test names and sends selected allocations through the fault injector. This keeps allocation tests separate from other test tasks. |
| `mining_test_instance.c` | Builds isolated instances of the real mining source and common-job builder. |
| `mining_allocator_fault_injector.*` | Fails one selected allocation and records allocation calls. A test can then check error handling and recovery. |

## Unit tests

| File | Unit behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `test_base58.c` | Base58 P2PKH and P2SH address encoding, including a small output buffer. |
| `test_bech32.c` | Bech32 and Bech32m address encoding for several witness types and networks, including invalid inputs. |
| `test_coinbase_decoder.c` | Varint bounds, payout address decoding, network formats, BIP-110 signaling, job input, and transaction locktime checks. |
| `test_common_jobs.c` | Common-job ownership, metadata validation, extranonce encoding, rolling eligibility, and coinbase allocation failure. |
| `test_job_building.c` | Coinbase hashing at stack and heap limits and allocation failure recovery. |
| `test_miner_job.c` | Miner-job pool slots, buffer ownership, index wraparound, and rollable-job checks. |
| `test_mining.c` | Coinbase hashes, Merkle roots, version-mask changes, and nonce difficulty using common Bitcoin headers. |
| `test_stratum_json.c` | SV1 JSON-RPC parsing, job fields, server messages, malformed input, line buffering, and size limits. |
| `test_utils.c` | Hashing, hex conversion, URL decoding, byte order at every buffer alignment, overlapping buffers, guard bytes, all 256 target bits and conversion edge cases, network difficulty, and difficulty conversion safety. |

## Test double names

- A **fake** returns scripted input, such as a task notification.
- A **spy** records a call or its data so a test can check it.
- A **stub** provides a fixed or empty implementation for behavior outside the
  test.
- A **harness** owns shared test state and connects the test doubles.
- A **test instance** builds real production source for use by the tests.
- A **fault injector** creates one requested failure for an error-path test.
